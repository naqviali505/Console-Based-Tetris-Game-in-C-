# OOP_Tetris-Game
For this software we will use keyboard  to control it and is very easy to use.
The program will start with the falling blocks of different shapes inside the bordered game table.
To move these shapes, we will use keys of keyboard. 
Alphabetic key ‘d’ will use to move left.
Alphabetic key ‘a’ will use to move right.
Alphabetic key ‘w’ will use to rotate the block.
Note:
•	Every time the alphabetic key ‘w’ will hit, the block on the screen on that time will rotate to 90 degrees. 
•	Game will end if all the blocks stacked up into each other and reach to the top of the game table. 
•	Total Score is also shown on the screen and will update after every successful attempt from the user to fill the row completely.
